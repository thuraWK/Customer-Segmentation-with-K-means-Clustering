# Customer Segmentation with K-means Clustering

In this project, I implemented K-means clustering to segment customers based on their age, annual income, and spending score. Used synthetic data for simulation, applied data preprocessing, and determined the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method. Evaluated the model's performance with the Silhouette Score and visualized the customer segments. Finally, saved the model for future predictions.
